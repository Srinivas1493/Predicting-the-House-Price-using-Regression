#Exploratory Data Analysis

Predictor	Effect	Rationale

Dependant Variable: pricesold 

Predictors:
sqft	+	The SQft positively affects the price
beds	+	Beds positively affect the price
bathstotal	+	Has positive effect
garage	+	Has a relatively positive effect;  as the house with more garages can be sold at a higher price
lotsqft	+	Has a significance to predict the dependent variable
yrblt	+/-	As the old built houses may reduce the price and newly built may increase the price
pool	+/-	A private Pool has more price whereas a house with no  amenities such as a pool may reduce the price
spa		Relatively lesser influence on the response variable
splsale	-	For a short sale  due to the customer’s urgency to dispose of the property, the seller may sell it at a reduced price
listprice	+	Positively affects the price sold
Cumulative Price on market	-	Affects the price
subdivn	+/-	House located in the secured area could be sold at a higher price and a house in a less secured area could be sold at a lower price
Excluded: Roof (as there is no influence)



#Fiding the correlation between the dependant and Independant variable

data1=cor(data[,c(4,5,6,7,8,9,12,17,18,20)])
corrplot(data1,method="number")
view(data$adom_agentdaysonmarket)
str(data)		

Interepretations
From the Correlation plot, we can infer the followings:
•	The variables such as “Sqft”, “bathstotal”, Beds” has a positive correlation.
•	Price sold Variable is greatly explained by continuous variables such as “Bathstotal”, “sqft”, lot sqft” , “Beds”.
•	Continuous variables such as adom_agentsdayson market and “cdom_cumulitavedays” has relatively less correlation on the price sold.

Model Building

#Model 1 - Baseline Model

data1<-as.data.frame(data)
library(ggplot2)
m1<-lm(pricesold~sqft+data1$Beds+data1$bathstotal,data=data1)
summary(m1)                                              

#Model 2- Squared Model
m2<-lm(pricesold~sqft+data1$Beds+data1$bathstotal+I(data1$sqft*data1$sqft),data=data1)
summary(m2)

#Model 3- Squared model along with factor variable

m3<-lm(pricesold~sqft+data1$Beds+data$bathstotal+
         I(data1$sqft*data1$sqft)+ 
         data1$yrblt, data=data1)
summary(m3)
plot(m3)

#Combined Output
library(stargazer)
stargazer(m1, m2, m3, type="text")
outfile = "C:/Users/srini/OneDrive/Desktop/SDM Assignment/MOdeloutputs.html"
stargazer(m1, m2, m3, title="OLS Analysis of Price Sold", out=outfile)


#LINE Assumptions verification

Linearity
summary(m3)
plot(data$pricesold,m3$fitted.values,main = 'Linear test',pch=19)
abline(0,1,lwd=2,col='blue')

plot(m3$fitted.values,m3$residuals,pch=19, main="Fitted Values Vs Residuals")
abline(0,0,lwd=2,col="blue")

Normality
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
#Histogram
hist(m3$residuals,col="red")
##QQplot
qqnorm(m3$residuals,pch=19)
qqline(m3$residuals)

#Equality of Variances

#Levene Test
leveneTest(m3$res,m3$fitted.values,center=mean)


#Independece
durbin.out=durbinWatsonTest(m3)
durbin.out

Interpretation
As the result of the D-W Test falls in the range of 1.5 to 2.5, there is no auto correlation here

#Assumptions Verification
Linearity	Yes
Homoskedasticity	
Yes
Normality	Partially Yes
Multicollinearity	No
Independence	Yes


#Final Inference
For the Model-3 we got the best Adjusted-R^2 of : 0.842 and it also satisfied the LINE assumptions and hence this is th best model
Also, the best predictors for the model are : sq.ft (Square footage), bathstotal (Total No of Bathroom) and beds (Total No of Bedrooms)
